Nord is a personal experiment in language design and compiler construction. I
don't know where this is going yet, but it should be fun!

Current State of the Project
===============================================================================
Last Updated: 06/13/2021

The current overall state is non-working, although some of the subsystems work
and have tests. The overall approach will be to bring each subsystem up and
in line with the grammar, evolve the grammar, and repeat until we have a useful
language. What follows is a bottom-up rundown of the overall status:

Grammar   -- Minimal. For the current iteration, check docs/grammar.txt
Lexer     -- Up to date with the grammar
Parser    -- Up to date with the grammar
Compiler  -- Nearly full grammar support
VM        -- Nearly full grammar support

Building
===============================================================================

To build the project, run:

    make

Doing so will produce a binary, "nord" which can then be run. What that binary
does will eventually be to run nord scripts, but it may do something else until
we have all subsystems up and running.

Testing
===============================================================================

To test things, run:

    make test
