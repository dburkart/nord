The nord virtual machine is a basic execution loop that emulates a simplified
machine with the following characteristics:

    - 256 numbered registers, which each hold a "value" (more on this below)
    - pseudo memory which is a dynamic array of values
    - stack memory which is also a dynamic array of values

Values
======

A value in the virtual machine is a composite type which can be any of the
following:

    - integer
    - float
    - boolean
    - string

A value object contains the type information, and either the value or a pointer
to the value.

Pseudo Memory
=============

Currently, all memory represented in the virtual machine is "pseudo memory".
This is essentially a dynamic array of values, the index of which is the
"address". So the value indicated by @2 is the 3rd value in the machine's
main memory.

Note: @0 and @1 are special addresses which hold false and true respectively.
